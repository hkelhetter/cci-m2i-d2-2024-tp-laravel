EN - Pepina App

    Use only templates folder for view because it's a simple app and symfony is too much for this. Changes config/view have been made to use only templates folder.
    Use admin-door for the admin part. Find this in public.
    I had misunderstood, but the guy from the association wanted to create and delete 'members', but I confused it with linking, and I used users sometimes, so I did not create a migration for them.
